PREAMBLE STUFF HERE

%pt_begin
Dear Hiring Manager: \newline

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
 \newline

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
The point of using \textbf{Lorem Ipsum} is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable \textsc{English}. 
Many desktop publishing \emph{packages} and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). \newline

I have accomplished:
\begin{itemize}
\item This,
\item and that too,
\item but also this.
\end{itemize}  \vspace{\baselineskip} 

I anxiously await your response for this position! \newline

Sincerely yours, \\
Myself
